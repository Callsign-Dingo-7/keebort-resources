# Keebort Resources

A small repository containing useful links to resources pertaining to Cherry MX-style (for now) mechanical keyboards.

## Want to Learn about Mechanical Keyboards?

Refer to this [YT Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8AJyqd8OBSjQh1ZHVFlEe6FgRSnn_T9&si=dc55ps5Kq5aa2R7B) for tutorials on various aspects of the hobby.

- Serves as great material for folks to revisit and rehash their knowledge base.
- You are more than welcome to contribute to this playlist thru GitHub Issues or if I post the playlist anywhere else on the net.

[Here](/useful-links.md) are a set of useful links, regardless of your experience in the hobby. If you are more experienced, you can visit these links as well as the [compiled cheap stuff](/cheap-and-useful-stuff.md) I've found and not miss out on much as of 3 Dec 2024.

## Want to Contribute?

First and foremost, thank you for considering to contribute :D

Currently, I am opening discussions to GitHub Issues to keep discussions open and transparent among members of the community. The mission is, and always will be, to accumulate a breadth of knowledge and resources to share among beginners and enthusiasts (including prospective engineers/designers) alike, so that everyone can benefit from this set of resources.

**Full Disclosure:** I am collaborating with some folks from the Keybroke community to explore making community-driven resources similar to BlackSimon's [chyna](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcJk5qE1jgwdBjeXSPYOETXIrJMdZbO3QTsZoRxrO0E)/[budget](https://blacksimon.tv/budget) sheets, but I will not be limiting any knowledge/contributions from other communities. Credit where credit is due.
